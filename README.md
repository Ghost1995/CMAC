# CMAC

**Problem Statement**

Program a Discrete CMAC and train it on a 1-D function. Explore effect of overlap area on generalization and time to convergence. Use only 35 weights for CMAC, and sample function at 100 evenly spaced points. Use 70 for training and 30 for testing. Report the accuracy of CMAC network using only the 30 test points.

Program a Continuous CMAC by allowing partial cell overlap, and modifying the weight update rule accordingly. Use only 35 weights weights for CMAC, and sample your function at 100 evenly spaced points. Use 70 for training and 30 for testing. Report the accuracy of CMAC network using only the 30 test points. Compare the output of the Discrete CMAC with that of the Continuous CMAC.

**Running the Code**

To run the code, just run main.m script.
